This repository implements a simple task management logic similar to Jira. 
It is built using FASTapi and includes functionality for creating users with different roles for access. 
Authentication is handled through JWT tokens. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, 
as well as retrieve a list of tasks and specific tasks by their ID. 
Additionally, there is a feature that simulates sending emails to task assignees when changes are made.

    venv\Scripts\activate
-
    ```bash
    # On macOS or Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
  
4. Establishing dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
5. Create an .env file in the root of the project and create the following keys in it

SECRET_KEY=a8u5T3j9R4nZ7mL1K2vQ6pX0eW9oB4rY7dV1sF3aC5hR8kL6wJ2iM4uO1tN7xP (make up your own secret key or use mine)
ALGORITHM=HS256

6. Launch of the FASTapi project
    ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload

7. follow the link
    ```bash

8. work verification and testing

In this section, you will set up users, who can either be assigned the role of a regular user or 
an admin (user/admin). Once a user is created, youâ€™ll have the ability to create tasks, 
as well as edit or delete them as needed.
