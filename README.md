This repository implements a simple task management logic similar to Jira. 
It is built using FASTapi and includes functionality for creating users with different roles for access. 
Authentication is handled through JWT tokens. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, 
as well as retrieve a list of tasks and specific tasks by their ID. 
Additionally, there is a feature that simulates sending emails to task assignees when changes are made.
